This is the project for the Machine Learning class

Given a dataset of 600 faces of 50 different individuals, the model "learns" 
the face of each individual and then can recognises each individual during testing
by labeling the image with the file name, which would be the name of that particular
individual. This face recognizer was implemented using the OpenCV python module which has an
in built classifier that can be used in object recognition.
